# Adventum
extra information for the Adventum modpack.

to get custom capes with the "capes" mod, go to minecraftcapes.net, register an account and upload a cape. You can find a cape either in the websites gallery or make one yourself, to apply the cape go to the skin settings, clikc on the cape icon, enable all capes and set you cape type to Minecraftcapes.

To use your vanilla or optifine cape, use that option instead. Anyone with a compatible mod will see your cape.

to use the customizable player models mod, follow these two excellent tutorials by Chilley: https://youtu.be/ULnyfCvtTH0 and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LouYA3KGpro

anyone using the mod will see the custom skin, and anyone without it will just see your normal one.

if the modpack causes your os to say "program is not responding" just press wait.
